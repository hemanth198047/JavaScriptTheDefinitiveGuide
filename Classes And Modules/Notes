Javascript Objects are already covered earlier. In that section, each object is treated as a unique set of properties, different from every object. 
It is often useful, however, to define a class of objects that share certain properties. Members, or instances of the classes have their own properties to hold or define their state but
they also have properties that define their behavior. this behaviour is defined by the class and is shared by all the instances of that class. For example, imagine there is a class
called Complex. This object or class will have properties to hold the data as well as properties to define the behavior of addition and multiplication. the data properties will be different
for each of the instances of this class whereas the behavior properties will be same for all the instances.

In Javascript, classes are based on prototype-based inheritence mechanism. If two objects inherits the properties from the same object, then they are said to be instances of that object.
If two objects inherits their properties from the same object, then we say these two objects are created and initialized from the same constructor function. the classes in javascript are quite
different from the classes that are defined in strongly typed languages like java and c++. One of the important features of javascript classes are that they are dynamically extendible.

Classes can be thought of as types.

Duck Typing
===========
Duck Typing refers to a concept that refers to how a language determines whether an object can be used in a particular context or not based on its properties and methods rather than the
actual type or class. The term comes from the saying "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck". This means that, in the context of programming, You don't
check the type of an object directly. Instead, you check whether the object has the required properties and methods.

Duck typing allows for more flexible and dynamic coding as objects interact with each other based on their properties and method instead of their rigid types. it enables polymorphism
where different objects that share similar behaviour can be used interchangeably.

Defining a class is a way of writing moduler, reusable code.

Classes and Prototypes
======================
In javascript, a class is a set of objects that inherits properties from the same prototype object. the prototype object, therefore, is the central feature of a class.
Earlier, we saw an example of inherit() method which returns a new object that inherits from a given prototype object. if we define a prototype object, and then use inherit() function
to create new objects using this prototype object, we defined a javascript class. Usually, the instances of a class requires further initialization and it is common to define a function that
creates and initializes a new object.

Refer app.js for inherit() function

An example to define a function that creates and initializes a new object is below
In this example, we will define a prototype object for a class that represents a range of values and also defines a "factory" function that creates and initializes a new instance of a class.

// range.js : A class representing a range of values
// This is a factory function that returns a new range object
function range(from, to) {
    // Use the inherit() function to create a new object that inherits from the prototype object defined below. The prototype object is stored
    // as a property of this function, and defines the shared methods (behaviour) for all range objects.
    var r = inherit(range.methods);

    // Store the start and end points (state) of this new range object 
    // These are non-inherited properties that are unique to this object.
    r.from = from;
    r.to = to;

    // Finally return the new object
    return r;
}

// This prototype object defines methods inherited by all range objects
range.methods = {
    // Return true if x is in the range, false otherwise
    // This works for textual and Date ranges as well as numeric
    includes: function (x) {
        return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;
    },
    // Invoke f once for each integer in the range.
    //This works only for numeric ranges
    foreach: function(f) {
        for (var x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++) {
            f(x);
        }
    },
    // Return a string representation of a range
    toString: function() {
        return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";
    }
};

// Here's example uses of a range object
var r = range(1,3);
r.includes(2);
r.foreach(console.log);
console.log(r);

In the above code, 
1. we defined a factory "range" function that creates objects from a prototype. Notice that we use a property of range function called methods to store the prototype object that defines
the class.
2. range function defines two properties from and to that stores dynamic data. These are unshared, uninherited properties that defines unique state of each individual range object.
3. range.methods is shared and inherited by all objects of this prototype. All these shared methods make use of from and to but they refer to them using this keyword so that they refer
to the specific object on which these methods are called.
4. the use of this is a fundamental characteristic of the methods of any class

Classes and Constructors
========================
In the above example, we saw how to define a class. But this is not an idiomatic way to define a class because it didn't defined a constructor. A Constructor is a function which is designed
specifically for initialization of a newly created object. Constructors are invoked using the new keyword. The invocation of a Constructor itself creates a new object, so that itself is enough
to perform the initialization of newly created object. The critical feature of constructor invocations is that the prototype object of the constructor is used as the prototype of the newly
created object. This means that all objects created from the same constructor will inherit from the same object and are therfore members of the same class. below example shows how we could
alter the range object to create new objects using the constructor instead of a factory function.

Example:

// range2.js : Another class representing a range of values

// This is a constructor function that initializes new objects.
// Note that it does not create or return the object. It just initializes this.

function Range(from, to) {
    // Store the start and end points (state) of this new range object.
    // These are noninherited properties that are unique to this object.
    this.from = from;
    this.to = to;
}

// All range objects inherit from this object
// Note that the property name must be "prototype" for this to work

Range.prototype = {
    // Return true if x is in the range, false otherwise
    // This method works for textual and Date ranges as well as numeric
    includes: function(x) {
        return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;
    },
    // Invoke f once for each integer in the range
    // This method works only for integers
    forEach: function(f) {
        for (var x = Math.ceil(this.from); x<= this.to; x++) {
            f(x);
        }
    },
    toString: function() {
        return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";
    }
};

//Here are example usages
var r = new Range(1,3);
r.includes(2);
r.forEach(console.log);
console.log(r);

When defining a constructor, we define with the first character with capital because Constructor function define classes and classes will have first character in caps.

also notice that the constructor functions are invoked with new keyword where range() factory method is invoked without new keyword. Because the keyword constructor is invoked with new keyword, there is no need to call inherit() function to create a new object. When Constructor is invoked with new keyword, the object is created before the constructor is called and is made
available using the this keyword. the Range() constructor has to merely initialize this. Constructors do not even need to return this newly created object. 

Constructor invocation automatically creates the new object, invokes the constructor as a function on this object and then returns this new object. Another point to note is that while
defining the prototype, in the first example, it was defined as range.method but in the second approach it was defined as Range.prototype. This is mandatory where the constructor prototype
needs to be assigned to the prototype property only.

Constructors and Class Identity
===============================
As we learned just now, prototype is the fundamental to the identity of a class. two objects are instances of same class only when they inherit from the same prototype object. the constructor
function that initializes the state of the new object is not fundamental. two constructor functions may have prototype properties that points to the same prototype object. in this case
two constructor functions can be used to create the instance of same class objects.

But in both the ways, constructors acts as the public face of a class. normally, the name of the constructor is adopted as the name of the class. for example, we say Range() constructor 
creates Range Objects. moreover, constructors are used with the instanceof operator to determine the membership of a class. If we have an object r and want to know if it is a Range object,
we can write as r instanceOf Range.

The instanceOf operator doesn't actually check whether r was created from the Range constructor but it checks whether r has a prototype same a Range prototype.

The Constructor Property
=======================
In previous examples, we defined a number of methods inside Range.prototype and it is convenient to express those methods as properties of the prototype. But this is not mandatory to create the new objects.
One point to note is that any javascript function can be used as a constructor but only thing needed is that that function should have a prototype property. Therefore, almost all the functions in javascript will automatically
have the prototype property in them. The value of this property will be an object that contains a single nonenumerable constructor property. the value of this constructor property is a function object.

Example:
    var F = function() {};
    var p = F.prototype;
    var c = p.constructor;
    c === F;

The existence of this predefined prototype object with its constructor property means that object typically inherits a constructor property that refers to their constructor. since constructors serve as public identity of a class
this constructor property gives class of an object
Example:
    var o = new F(); // This creates an object o of class F
    o.constructor === F; // true: constructor property specifies the class

In the above example, originally we have overriden the prototype property of the Range object and this new object that was assigned to the prototype property don't have a constructor defined in it. so, in this case
the Range objects that are generated using this prototype will not have constructor property in it. We can remedy this problem by explicitly defining constructor property in the Range.prototype

Range.prototype = {
    constructor: Range,
    includes: function(x) {
        return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;
    },
    forEach: function (f) {
        for(var x = this.from; x<= this.to; x++) {
            f(x);
        }
    },
    toString: function() {
        return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";
    }
};

Another common technique is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property and add methods to it one at a time;
Range.prototype.includes = function(x) {return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;};
Range.prototype.foreach = function(f) {for(var x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++) f(x);};
Range.prototype.toString = function() {return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";};
